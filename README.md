### Eric's Personal Set-Up Notes

 * Eric, you created a separate github key for this that's in your .ssh directory.
 * There is a routes problem with jasminerice that you punted on. See https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10100
 * switched to using unicorn for Heroku therefore start the local webserver with the command:

  foreman start
